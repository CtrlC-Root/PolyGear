# Introducing PolyGear

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dpellegr/PolyGear/master/imgs/PolyGear.gif "PolyGear")

PolyGear is a powerful OpenSCAD library to create **spur** and **bevel gears** as a single polyhedron. The library allows full control of the **involute tooth profile**, including pressure angle, backlash, variable helix angle, addendum, dedendum and profile shifting.

Being able to vary the helix angle allows for instantaneous generation and switch between herringbone, zerol, spiral and customized profiles; all constructed as a single and smooth polyhedron even for small facet number.

The gear is constructed in an **extremely efficient** way, by triangulating a minimalist vertex cloud with a single polyhedron.

I wrote this library because I was unsatisfied with the existing ones:

* https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3575
* https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:636119
* https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1604369

being, to my taste, either too hampered, fragile or computational expensive. My aim has been overcoming these limitations. Do not expect lightening holes or other gimmicks, but comprehensive and efficient control over your gear teeth.

The main library file is well commented, and self-suffice as **documentation** for the various parameters and commands. If you need more insight please refer to the Knowledge Base and FAQ sections below.
________________

## Requirements:
Polygear requires **OpenSCAD v2019.05** or more recent. Using older version is discouraged, but feasible with minor modifications, see https://github.com/dpellegr/PolyGear/issues/2.

## Library files:

 * PolyGear.scad - main file, the one that you should read and *use (NOT include)* in your project
 * PolyGearBase.scad - computation of the gear profile and some meshing functions
 * PolyGearUtils.scad - collection of more and less trivial complementary functions
 * linspace.scad - lightweight library for producing range of points
 * shortcuts.scad - a slightly enhanced version of the [excellent shortcuts library](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:644830) by [Parkinbot](https://www.thingiverse.com/Parkinbot/about)

## Knowledge Base:

The library uses industry standard terminology and conventions. KHK Gears published an [excellent summary](https://github.com/dpellegr/PolyGear/blob/master/docs/Basic%20Gear%20Terminology%20and%20Calculation%20-%20KHK%20Gears.pdf)
 which is mirrored in the docs folder for convenience. If words like "module" and "pressure angle" confuses you, please make sure to review it.

If you want to dive deeper in the evaluation/parameterization of the involute profiles, [this nice open access paper](https://github.com/dpellegr/PolyGear/blob/master/docs/Hartig%20Stein%20-%203D%20involute%20gear%20evaluation.pdf), is what inspired the computations implemented in PolyGearBase.scad.

## FAQ:

### What is this "module" thing? Can't I just specify the radius?

You can think about the module as a universal measure of the size of the tooth. Having the same module is the first requisite when evaluating the proper meshing of two gears, and therefore it is very deeply rooted into the industry standard and well described in the document from KHK Gears linked above. You could use the radius, but in the long run it would hurt yourself with fractional number of teeth and/or non meshing gears.

If you really want to go the radius way, specify a random module, then use the OpenSCAD `resize()` command, but you have been warned...

### How are Bevel Gears constructed/determined?

The construction of the bevel gears starts from the reference circle of the bottom face. It is always centered at the origin of the XY plane and its radius (*r<sub>ref</sub>* in the figure above) is determined by the module and the number of teeth (as for spur gears).
The next important parameter is the `cone_angle` *‚ç∫* defined as half of the vertex angle of the cone on which the teeth of the gear lie.
Finally one needs to define either `w` or `z`, the first represents the slant height of the teeth (parallel to the cone face), the second is the height of the teeth (parallel to the cone axis which is the z axis). Preferring `w` over `z` ensures matching tooth widths when pairing gears with different cone angles.

At this point the reference radius of the top face is determined and the construction is completed.

### Why does the bottom face of my bevel gear lie at negative z?

This is because the end faces of the teeth of the bevel gears are constructed by projecting the end faces of the teeth of a spur gear (which are planar) on the spherical suface centered at the cone vertex and passing by the reference circle.

In the figure above the end-faces of the teeth of the corresponding spur gear are marked in blue. Their projection on the spherical surface is marked in red, as well as the resulting bevel gear.

This kind of construction is needed to allow the whole tooth side of two meshing gears (with the same `w`) to be fully in contact, whithout having their ends sticking outside of each other.

### I still have difficulties using the library, any further advice?

While developing your design, it can be helpful envisioning gears as smooth cylinders (spur) and cones (bevel) determined by their reference radius. In this way you can focus on specify their size and positioning. The library will then take care of producing properly meshing teeth on their lateral surfaces.
